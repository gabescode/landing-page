Hello! In this project I am going to try to attempt to create a solid looking landing page for practice, this will be done with the help of the odin project.
although its hands free so I will have to do everything myself, unless I am really need help and need to reach out.

This will be my first project ever; well, serious project anyways. I am hoping to create something in a reasonable amount of time, even though I am not that great with Flexbox I am hoping
to gain more confidence and skills and knowledge with Flexbox. Because I know how to use it, but just not efficiently I think.

By the end of this project I hope to come out with :

1. a solid understanding of flexbox and become more comfortable using it.
2. more practice and use of git and pushing and commiting and getting comfortable with it.
3. More foundational knowledge of HTML
4. More practice with CSS and getting to use more properties and what not.
5. Being able to build something on my own that looks decent.

My goals for this project :

1. Being able to create something from scratch by myself
2. Making something I deem acceptable and that I am happy with.
3. Having something to show for my time spent coding to see how much I learned.
